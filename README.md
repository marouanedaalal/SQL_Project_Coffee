Run the SQL script in the following order to avoid foreign key issues:
1. **city**
2. **products**
3. **customers**
4. **sales**

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sales, customers, products, city;

CREATE TABLE city (
  city_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  city_name VARCHAR(15),
  population BIGINT,
  estimated_rent FLOAT,
  city_rank INT
);

CREATE TABLE products (
  product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_name VARCHAR(35),
  price FLOAT
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_name VARCHAR(25),
  city_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (city_id) REFERENCES city(city_id)
);

CREATE TABLE sales (
  sale_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  sale_date DATE,
  product_id INT,
  customer_id INT,
  total FLOAT,
  rating INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
